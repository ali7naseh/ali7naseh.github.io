I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences at UMass Amherst, advised by [Amir Houmansadr](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~amir/). My general research interest lies in trustworthy machine learning, with a current focus on various aspects of trustworthy generative AI, including large language models and multimodal models. I obtained my bachelor's degree from Sharif University of Technology.
